        <p><strong>NARRATOR 1:</strong> Mary and her husband Joseph often wished for God’s presence in their problem-filled world.</p>

        <p><strong>ANGEL GABRIEL:</strong> Peace be with you, Mary! I have come to save you and your town!</p>
        <p><strong>MARY:</strong> What? Who are you? What do you mean?</p>
        <p><strong>ANGEL GABRIEL:</strong> Don’t be afraid of me, Mary. God is pleased with you! You will become pregnant and give birth to a baby, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and people will call him their savior!</p>
        <p><strong>MARY:</strong> This is so strange... am I dreaming? A son? The Savior? God?</p>
        <p><strong>ANGEL GABRIEL:</strong> It’s pretty awesome, right? Your town is in desperate need of some help. Your baby will be holy! He will be the son of God.</p>
        <p><strong>MARY:</strong> The son of God?</p>
        <p><strong>ALL LITTLE ANGELS:</strong> Bye Mary!</p>
        <p><strong>MARY:</strong> Wait! Don’t leave! I have more questions!</p>
        <p><strong>ANGEL GABRIEL:</strong> Sorry Mary, you must face the rest of this story yourself, but God above is watching you.</p>

        <p><strong>JOSEPH:</strong> You go first!</p>
        <p><strong>MARY:</strong> I am pregnant! But not just pregnant with a baby, but pregnant with the son of God! The savior of all people! The King!</p>
        <p><strong>JOSEPH:</strong> (gasps) God has answered our prayers! We will no longer suffer as we have before!</p>
        <p><strong>MARY:</strong> Yes! We will be happy! And what is your news?</p>
        <p><strong>JOSEPH:</strong> Oh. My news is that the emperor has declared a census. That means we must travel to my hometown all the way in Bethlehem to be counted.</p>
        <p><strong>MARY:</strong> But I am pregnant!</p>
        <p><strong>JOSEPH:</strong> Oh no...</p>
        <p><strong>MARY</strong> and <strong>JOSEPH</strong> exit.</p>

<p><strong>SCENE 3</strong></p>

<p><strong>KING HERROD</strong> walks on.</p>
        <p><strong>NARRATOR 2:</strong> Meanwhile, the evil King Herrod was not happy with the news of this new king.</p>
        <p><strong>JULIET, FAFA,</strong> and <strong>NAOMI</strong> run on with a scroll.</p>
        <p><strong>KING HERROD:</strong> Messengers! What news do you bring? (reads note) What?! The son of God? This is unacceptable! I am the king, not this new chap! He cannot live on! Wise men!</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 1</strong> and <strong>WISE MAN 2</strong> take off their shawls and run onstage.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 1:</strong> We are the glamorous and fabulous...</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 2:</strong> The rich and sparkly... Wise men!</p>
        <p>Wise men point to their sequins.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 1:</strong> Yes my king?</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 2:</strong> We are here!</p>
        <p><strong>KING HERROD:</strong> I have had news about a very powerful baby, that is to be born soon. As you are very wise, you should know where he is being born, so I can ensure he never grows up, he never becomes more powerful than me!</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 1:</strong> (talking to audience) In fact, we did know where he was being born. We had prophesied it.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 2</strong> acts out reading a magic ball.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 2:</strong> Yes, but we also knew that the new king would be a good thing for the people, and would help them get a better life.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 1:</strong> And the king was planning to kill him! So we kept our knowledge secret.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 2:</strong> (turning to <strong>KING HERROD</strong>) Sorry my king, we don’t know.</p>
        <p><strong>KING HERROD:</strong> Errrrr! I have to do everything myself around here!</p>
        <p><strong>KING HERROD</strong> storms off.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 1:</strong> Oh no! What if he finds the baby? We must go to Bethlehem to protect him.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MAN 2:</strong> And praise him! He will be our king someday. Let’s go.</p>
        <p><strong>WISE MEN</strong> leave.</p>

<p><strong>SCENE 4</strong></p>

<p><strong>WISE MAN 2 stops right before the exit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NARRATOR 2:</strong> In the meantime, Mary and Joseph had just began their long, tiresome journey to Bethlehem.</p>
